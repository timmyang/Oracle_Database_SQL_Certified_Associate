Using Single-Row Functions to Customize Output
- Manipulating strings with character functions in SQL SELECT and WHERE clauses
- Manipulating numbers with the ROUND, TRUNC and MOD functions
- Performing arithmetic with Date data
- Manipulating dates with the Date function
*/

/*
A Function is a subprogram that takes an input (argument) and return a value

Functions are very powerful feature of SQL. They can do:

- Perform calculations on data
- Modify individual data items
- Manipulate output for groups of rows
- Format dates and numbers for display
- Convert column data types

SQL functions "sometimes" take arguments and "always" return a value
*/

/*
Two types of SQL functions:

- Single-Row functions: return one result per row
- Multiple-Row functions: return one result per set of rows
*/

/*
Single-row functions:

- Manipulate data items
- Accept arguments and return one value
- Act on each row that is returned
- Reutrn one result per row
- May modify the data type
- Can be nested
- Accept arguments that can be a column or an expression

/*
Single-row functions have five categories:

- Character: 
    (case-conversion functions) LOWER, UPPER, INITCAP
    (character-manipulation) CONCAT, SUBSTR, LENGTH, INSTR, LPAD, RPAD, TRIM, REPLACE
- Number: 
    ROUND, TRUNC, MOD
- Date:
    MONTHS_BETWEEN, ADD_MONTHS, NEXT_DAY, LAST_DAY, ROUND, TRUNC
- Conversion:
    to_date, to_char
- General:
    NVL, NVL2, nullif, coalesce, decode, case
*/


--1 Character function

/*
- LOWER(column/expression):
    Converts alpha character values to lowercase
- UPPER(column/expression):
    Converts alpha character values to uppercase
- INITCAP(column/expression):
    Converts alpha character values to uppercase for the first letter of each word.
    All other letters in lower case
*/

-- case converstion functions (UPPER, LOWER, INITCAP)
SELECT employee_id, first_name, UPPER(first_name), LOWER(first_name), INITCAP(first_name)

-- Single row function can be used in SELECT, WHERE and ORDER BY

SELECT employee_id, first_name, UPPER(first_name), LOWER(first_name), INITCAP(first_name)

-- character manipulation function
/*
- CONCAT(column1/expression1, column2/expression2):
    Concatenates the first character value to the second character value.
    Equivalent to concatenation operator (||)
- SUBSTR(column/expression, m[, n]):
    Returns specified characters from character value starting at character position
    "m" for "n" characters long.
    If "m" is negative, the count starts from the end of the character value.
    If "n" is ommited, all characters to the end of the string are returned.
- LENGTH(column/expression):
    Returns the number of characters in the expression
- INSTR(column/expression, 'string', [,m], [n]):
    Returns the numeric position of a named string.
    Optionally, you can provide a position "m" to start searching,
    and the occurence "n" of the string. 
    "m" and "n" are default to 1, meaning it starts the search at the beginning
    of the string and reports the first occurrence.
- LPAD(column/expression, n, 'string'):
    Returns an expression left-padded to length of "n" characters with a character expression
- RPAD(column/expression, n, 'string'):
    Returns an expression right-padded to length of "n" characters with a character expression.
- TRIM(leading/trailing/both, trim_character FROM trim_source):
    Enables you to trim leading or trailing characters (or both) from a character string.
    If trim_character or trim_source is a character literal, you must enclose it in single quotation marks.
    This is a feature that is available in Oracle 8i or later versions.
- REPLACE(text, search_string, replacement_string):
    Searches a text expression for a character string and, if found, replaces it
    with a specified replacement string
